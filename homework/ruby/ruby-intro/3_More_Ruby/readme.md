# HW Reading: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

[POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) (pronounced "pooder") explains object-oriented design (OOD) in Ruby. Javascript is an object-oriented language but it is not class-based like it is in Ruby, Java, C++, C, etc.. POODR was written by Sandi Metz, a software developer and author focused on writing flexible object-oriented code in Ruby and Rails.

## Exercise Objectives

- have fun reading material on programmatic thinking and design
- gain insight to programming languages from a design standpoint
- gain an intermediate level of understanding Ruby as a class-based language
- start thinking about the differences in Javascript and Ruby

## Directions

Read the first 3 chapters of POODR [available as a PDF here](https://github.com/edenzik/cs105b/blob/master/books/Practical%20Object-Oriented%20Design%20in%20Ruby.pdf) and answer the questions below.


### Short Answer Questions:

Answer should be no more than a couple of sentences. Refer to the reading.

1. According to Metz, what is Object-oriented design about?

```
can lower your cost and improve your applications 
```

2. What does SOLID stand for?

```
Single-responsiblity principle
open-closed 
liskov sub
interface seg
dependecy inversio 
```

3. Ruby is a class-based object-oriented language. What does that mean?

```
it means that each piece of the program is a smaller object, to help with scalablity to not break the program if a change needed to be made.

6. What does `attr_reader` do?
